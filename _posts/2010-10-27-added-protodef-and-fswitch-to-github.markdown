Well, I got another patch from someone for [protodef](http://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-protodef). It was just getting silly that I didn't have anywhere to actually put this stuff and I was getting tired of people sending patches :). Now y'all can just fix stuff for me directly... go to it.

[Head here for protodef](http://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-protodef).
[Head here for fswitch](http://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-fswitch).
