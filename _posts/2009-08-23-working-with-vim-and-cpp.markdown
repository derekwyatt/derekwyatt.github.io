Vim's got the power to work with C++, oh yes :) Over the years I've tweaked my C++ setup with Vim to include a few plugins and a number of settings and functions. If you're a C++ programmer, these little bits of configuration might just help you out. I've broken this up into two major pieces:

- [General settings](general-cpp-settings) that don't really *require* plugins.
- [Snippet-based settings](cpp-snippets). Snippets represent a seriously powerful mechanism for dealing with code and C++ is no exception.
