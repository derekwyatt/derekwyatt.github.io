I've finally updated [FSwitch](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2590) and [ProtoDef](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2624) after a long time waiting. Three guys gave me patches over many months and I've finally put them together into an actual couple of releases.

Thanks to Matt Spear, Timon Kelter and Dmitry Bashkatov.  Sorry about the wait fellas.
