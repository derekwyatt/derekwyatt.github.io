Well, I just updated to the latest [BoinxTV](http://www.boinxtv.com) (a beta release, in fact) and some problems that I was having earlier appear to have disappeared! Things are much more stable now - in fact, I don't see any flaws anymore at all and I have just completed my first video with it, which should be uploaded soon.

I got [BoinxTV](http://www.boinxtv.com) as part of [MacHeist 3](http://www.macheist.com) so this was a *serious deal* and for the moment, I couldn't be happier.
