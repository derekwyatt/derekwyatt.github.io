I've had a number of people ask me when my next [Vim Video](/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/) is going to go online... I know it's been a while since I put one up, and unfortunately it's going to be a while longer.

Work has picked up in the last little while and on top of that, I'm buying a new house and am preparing for the move. After the move finishes I should be able to do another one. The only real problem is that the new videos are going to be of the intermediate and advanced quality and those take a lot more thought and time :)

I appreciate all the great responses, encouragement and all the interest!  Keep reading those help files and stay tuned...
