David Fishburn (of [vim\_use Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/about) and [other](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=837) fame), suggested that I put up some videos regarding the `vimrc` file, and I thought that this was a great idea, so I started this morning - not with the videos though :) I want to get a decent idea of what I want to talk about before diving into that medium, so I started with a bit of work on this site with some pages on the `vimrc`. So far all I've got is the bare minimum, but I'll be fleshing that out in the near future.
