title: The Blog Goes Mobile
---
I surf a lot on my [BlackBerry](http://blackberry.com) and my own website was brutal for it. I tried a ton of themes and was completely disappointed. All I had to do was install the [Wordpress Mobile Pack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-mobile-pack/) and Voila! [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com)... Why did I ever try to build a website from scratch? This thing's got everything!
