title: How to use the Vim Help System is Online
---
[How to use the Help System](/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-novice-tutorial-videos#Help) is now online, and I think this may finish off the ["Novice"](/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-novice-tutorial-videos/) set of videos. We've done a lot of good work moving forward with "How to use Vim", and this video will give you some assistance with helping yourself using Vim's [superb help system](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/).

I think the next video on the agenda will cover the [runtime](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'runtimepath') directory so that we can start dealing with [plugins](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_05.html#plugin) and customization a bit better before we dive back in to some more esoteric editing concepts.
