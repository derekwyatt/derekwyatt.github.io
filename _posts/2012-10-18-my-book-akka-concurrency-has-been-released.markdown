I've been working on a book since March, 2012 called [*Akka Concurrency*](http://www.artima.com/shop/akka_concurrency/) and on Monday, Oct 15th 2012, it went live at [Artima](http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=270&thread=346485). I'm really happy to see it make this milestone - it's been a long time coming!

The book builds on the existing, and excellent [Akka Documentation](http://akka.io/docs) by going beyond the *what* and the basic *how* of [Akka](http://akka.io/) and into the *why*, as well as covering some more of the esoteric bits of the *how* as well. It's a unique pleasure to see the wonderful documentation that the Akka team has developed. If they hadn't done such a great job, I believe that I wouldn't have wanted to write this book in the first place.

I hope that the Akka community finds it helpful and it brings more developers into this fantastic toolkit. Please head over to [Artima](http://www.artima.com/) and have a look at [*the book*](http://www.artima.com/shop/akka_concurrency/). Take a look at the table of contents, as well as the [sample chapter](http://www.artima.com/samples/AkkaDoesConcurrencyCh4.pdf) and, if you like it, you just might want to grab a copy!
