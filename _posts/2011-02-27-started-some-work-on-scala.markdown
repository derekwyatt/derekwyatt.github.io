So, a little over a month ago, I changed departments where I work - I used to work in the Enterprise Software group and have moved to the System Architecture / Research group. There are some great things that go with this:

1. I get to work with Vim more than I used to because I now code a lot more than I used to.
2. I've effectively *deleted* Windows entirely and replaced it with *Ubuntu* (YAY!)
3. I'm getting a chance to deeply investigate [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) and [Akka](http://akka.io), which is a real treat! My research may not go anywhere, but the research itself is incredibly useful, I think - Scala and Akka are absolutely fantastic projects.

Once I figure out the right path to take in order to get some changes into the Scala repository for Vim, I'll do that, but for the moment I'm just having a great time banging away at the docs and shoving things in my own repository.

What I've got at the moment is a 4000+ line reference file (in Vim help format, of course) that I've put together to help me better understand Scala, and give me a spot to put some critical information and tips / tricks I find as I go. I've also fixed up the indent file a bit and plan to enhance the syntax file when I get a chance too.

Because of Scala's flexibility and terseness I find it a bit difficult to create code snippets for it, but I may do that in the future as well.

If you're interested, head over to [my vim-scala repository on GitHub](http://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-scala) and clone it down to your vim configuration.
