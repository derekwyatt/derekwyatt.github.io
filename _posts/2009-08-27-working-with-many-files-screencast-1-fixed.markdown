title: Working with Many Files (Screencast 1) FIXED

I had to redo the Working with Many Files (Screencast 1) video because there was some weird audio encoding problem with it that Vimeo just wasn't happy dealing with. But, at any rate, it appears to work correctly now!

Have a look at [Working with Many Files (Screencast 1)](http://vimeo.com/6306508).
