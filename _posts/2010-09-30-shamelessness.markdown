Alright... I've had a lot of traffic lately and a lot of people emailing me (something's occurred on the inter-web recently that's picked up the interest in these videos beyond the usual 1k views per week... I don't know what it was). This has sparked my interest in making more videos so that's what I'm going to try and do.

But, in the last few months, I've also had a number of people asking me where they can send me a virtual beer, and I've had no place to do that. I never really cared, but hey... if a few bucks can offset my website costs every year then what the hell?

So, if you feel like making a donation of a few bucks, feel free to do so, and if you don't, feel free to not do so :) Whatever you do, keep using Vim, and if you feel like making a donation to the Vim project instead, [*please do*](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php).
