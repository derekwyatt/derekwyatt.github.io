I've just made a few updates to the [vimrc](/vim/the-vimrc-file/) section of this site to describe a bit more about what the vimrc is, where it can be found, etc... As well, I updated the bare minimum to include ['wildmenu'](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'wildmenu') - an absolute must!
