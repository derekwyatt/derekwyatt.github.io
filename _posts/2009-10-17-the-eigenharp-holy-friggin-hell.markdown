I just happened to see [this story at engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/11/video-mysterious-eigenharp-offers-blinkenlight-sitar-looks-chi/) and dug a little deeper to find the [EigenHarp at EigenLabs](http://www.eigenlabs.com/). This is possibly the coolest friggin' [MIDI Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midi_controller) (almost) on the market today. It's ridiculously expensive - *way* out of my price range at close to `$7k` (it is just a controller after all - you still gotta have a computer and some soft synths, I believe) but that doesn't diminish it's complete and utter coolness!

I play an [EWI 4000s](http://www.akaipro.com/ewi4000s) which is a wicked cool super powerhouse MIDI Controller, but compred to the [EigenHarp](http://www.eigenlabs.com/) it looks like it was invented over 20 years ago (which it was :D). The EigenHarp is like some sort of psychedelic [Bassoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassoon) with its LEDs, tons of keys, and insane levels of control - well, it's just a beast of a controller.

I can't wait to see what happens with this thing over the next few years.
