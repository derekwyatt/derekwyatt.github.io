Rick over at [Lococast.Net](http://lococast.net/) has some great screencasts up for Vim. I've watched a couple of them now, and I'm a happy dood... nice stuff! Go check 'em out. Go... go now... stop... no, don't do that, you know what I mean... that thing you were going to do, that dirty, naughty, disgusting thing?? Yeah, that. Don't. Go watch his screencasts instead. Go [here instead](http://Lococast.net/).
