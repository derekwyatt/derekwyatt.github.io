I've never seen [Oblivion][1] before - yeah, it's an "older" movie now, but Netflix exists for come-late-to-the-party guys like me - so when I saw it pop up on [Netflix][2], I eagerly clicked on it, and was presented with this:

Hmm... interesting.  So, clearly [Tom Cruise][3] has a doppleganger in this movie; I'm sure that's not a _huge_ surprise twist in the plot at all, right?  Netflix... you suck today ;P
