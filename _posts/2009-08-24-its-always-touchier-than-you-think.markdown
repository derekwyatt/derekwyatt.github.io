I took a shot at the [C++ no-namespace indenting for Vim](/2009/08/23/no-namespace-indent-for-c-with-vim/) and thought I had it, but of course this sort of thing is always a pain. I think it's more solid now but I make no guarantees :). You can find the indent code as part of the [General C++ Settings](/vim/working-with-vim-and-cpp/general-cpp-settings/) file that should go in `$VIM/after/ftplugin/cpp.vim`.
