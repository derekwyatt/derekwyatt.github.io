Yup, I'm an idiot.  I've had a <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> account for a long time now, mostly for the email address, and I went to <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> to set up my vim-related blog - the free one.  Why the hell would I do that??  <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a> gives me the same thing, plus all the extras because I've <i>already paid for it</i>.  Eventually I clued in :)

I'll probably be changing some cosmetics and such over the next short while but the content should be staying the same - I'll just be adding more.
