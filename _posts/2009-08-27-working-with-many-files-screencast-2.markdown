title: Working with Many Files (Screencast 2)
---
The second video about [Working with Multiple Files](http://vimeo.com/6307101) is now online. Vimeo is still converting [Screencast 1](http://vimeo.com/6306508), even though I uploaded that one first - it's been a really lucky day for me today :). Hopefully that one will be done soon. This video covers:

- The [args](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#:args) list, and moving through it.
- The [buffer](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#:buffers) list, and moving through it.
- The [bufdo](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/windows.html#:bufdo) command and touches on its super powers.

These are all in support of running [Just One Vim](http://vimeo.com/4446112).
