The Vim 'indent' script for Scala that I've been working on is now starting to take some decent shape. If you're a Scala coder and are working in Vim, I can now actually recommend this script :). It's actually the least complicated one I've written that achieves this level of functionality; I've had a few kicks at this particular can and one of them in particular was **way** complicated and also *slow*.

[Go grab it from Github](http://github.com/ewiplayer/vim-scala).
