We're going to start covering a very important topic in the next series: [Working with Many Files (Screencast 1)](http://vimeo.com/6306508). I plan on covering a full range of complexity on this topic but the first video is going to cover the dead basics:

- How to list the buffers that are currently known and visible.
- How to switch between buffers.
- How to delete buffers.

That's it :) We are starting with the basics here folks. Trust me, it will get more interesting.
