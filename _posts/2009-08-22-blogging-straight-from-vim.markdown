Ah, now this is complete bliss... I'm writing to you straight from within [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) using the [blogit.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2582) script. Up until now, the best way I could use Vim to write up on this site was to use [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/)'s great little feature of hacking [Cocoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)) to allow you to edit any [NSTextField](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTextField_Class/Reference/Reference.html) natively within the [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) session. But now, I can just write straight within [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/) and then publish directly from here.

I owe a big thanks to [Romain Bignon](http://romain.peerfuse.org/) for this one. Excellent plugin!
