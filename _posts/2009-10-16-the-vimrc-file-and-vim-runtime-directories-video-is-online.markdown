I put up a new video that describes the [vimrc](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/starting.html#vimrc) and the Vim [runtime](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'runtimepath') directories.

You can have a look [right here](/vim/vim-tutorial-videos/vim-intermediate-tutorial-videos/#vimrc).
