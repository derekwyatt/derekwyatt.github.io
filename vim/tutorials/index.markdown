title: Vim Tutorial Videos

I've been doing some video tutorials that are hosted on [vimeo][1] for a little while now and they've reached a decent critical mass.  However, they aren't all that well organized - not that vimeo doesn't give you a decent way to organize them, it's just that I'm incredibly cheap and you need to pay an upgrade fee to get an unlimited number of albums.  So I organize them a bit better here.  Check the child pages to see what videos are available.
