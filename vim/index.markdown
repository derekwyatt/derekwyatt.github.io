Do it all, Do it right, Do it in Vim
------------------------------------

I am a _huge_ fan of [Vim] [1].  [Bram Moolenaar] [2], and all of the other authors deserve some _serious_ credit for making this amazing edition of good ol' [Vi] [3] because it's just about the best app that has ever been written in the history of software.  Thanks a lot Bram :)

I'm hoping to help out the Vim community and the authors by writing some information on this blog, posting some tidbits of information on [Twitter] [4], and posting some [vidoes] [5] on [vimeo] [6].

You can check out my videos by continuing to the [tutorials] [7] section.
