My name is Derek Wyatt. I'm a cloud developer and architect, specializing in building large-scale services for the web.  You can find me on [Twitter] [1] and [Github] [2] where I tend to talk a lot about [Scala] [3], [Akka] [4] and [Vim] [5].  This blog is really about whatever the heck I want to talk about, which will probably be most centred around those same things, cuz they're a lot of fun.

I published a book with [Artima Publishing] [6] in 2013 called [Akka Concurrency] [7] that describes how to write software using [Akka] [4].  It focuses on the "philosophy" of programming concurrency in the [Akka] [4] paradigm as well as the nuts-and-bolts of making it happen.
