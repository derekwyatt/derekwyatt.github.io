I write about [Cloud][3] architecture stuff, [Scala][2] stuff, [Vim][4] stuff, [Akka][1] stuff, and whatever the hell else I feel like. I've got a history of building backend / enterprise systems for "big stuff" in the past.  If you're interested in my CV, head to [LinkedIn][5].  If you wanna reach out, head to [Twitter][6] - I'd love to hear from you!
